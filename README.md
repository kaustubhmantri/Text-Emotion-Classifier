# Text-Emotion-Classifier

## Welcome to the Text Emotion Classifier! This is a web app that predicts the emotion behind any text you provide, whether it's happy, sad, angry, or more!

### How the project works
- The model is built with Keras and it analyzes the text you input to predict an emotion.
- It breaks down your text into words (tokenization) and prepares it for the model.
- The model is based on LSTM (a type of neural network) which is great for understanding the context in sentences.
- The model learns from sample data and then predicts the emotion in new text.

### How Itâ€™s Made
- Frontend: Streamlit (to create the user interface)
- Backend: Python
- Machine Learning: TensorFlow and Keras (for emotion prediction)
- Data Processing: NLTK and Scikit-learn (to clean and process the text)
